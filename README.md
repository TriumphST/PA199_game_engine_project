# PA199_project
This is a school assignemnt project of implementation of game engine and “circular” breakout game in 3D. Everything is created from scratch in C++, OpenGL and GLSL. 

Implemented:
- Math:
  - Vectors
  - Matrixes
  - Rays
  - Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems


- Physics:
  - Objects movement
  - Collision detection
  - Bounce


- Graphics:
  - Colors
  - Phong shading
  - Textures


- Mesh generation (vertexes, normals, indexes, texture coords)
  - icosphere
  - paddle (curved prism)
  - circle
